# Geolocation App

This project is created with React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. It is an SPA to get "GeoJSON features" of a location given with the coordinates (as geolocation box).

After you clone and render the app on your local machine, the only thing you need to do is selecting an area on the map using the tools at the right hand side, and clicking on the selected area to see the GeoJSON features associated with the location.
